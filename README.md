# Deepfake-voice_detection_Yamnet
This repository contains a machine learning-based system to detect deepfake (synthetic) voices. The system utilizes audio feature extraction techniques such as YAMNet and deep learning models (ANN, CNN, RNN) to differentiate between real and fake audio.

# üöÄ Features
- Audio Preprocessing: Converts raw audio into meaningful features.
- Feature Extraction: Uses YAMNet to extract embeddings from audio signals.
- Dataset : Uses the kaggle "In The Wild (audio Deepfake)" dataset for training the model.[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallamohamed312/in-the-wild-audio-deepfake)
- Deep Learning Models: Implements ANN, CNN, and RNN architectures for classification.
- Training & Evaluation: Trains models with labeled datasets and evaluates accuracy.
- Inference API: Provides an API to classify input audio as real or deepfake.
